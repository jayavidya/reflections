How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you
see the bug that was introduced?
There was a typo in one line of the new file. Using diff, it was 
very easy to spot this typo, because the diff tool clearly shows
the line-by-line difference between two files. It would have been 
more difficult to find this typo manually.
