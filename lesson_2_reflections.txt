What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When I initialize a repository the file .git is created. This subdirectory contains all of the necessary metadata of the repo.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area consists of all the files that will go into your next commit.

The working directory is a singe checkout of one version of the project.These files are pulled out of the compressed database in the Git directory and placed on disk for you to use or modify.

The repository is where Git stores the metadata and the object database for your project,  and it is what is copied when you clone a repo from another computer.
