When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping 
all your work local?
I would like to use a remote repository when I wish to share my project
files with others in my team. This would enable others to see my code,
and make any required changes in the files, or add any new features 
to the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?
 Manually pulling changes  allows me to remember that certain changes have been made
 in the  file and they are copied to the local repository.  

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branches are created within your own local repository. Branches are
created to add new features in an existing project.
Clones allow us to create a copy of repository on local computer 
from central repo (GitHub).
Fork copies another repository into your GitHub account.

what is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the 
remote stored locally?
The main benefit of having a copy of the last known state 
of the remote stored locally is that the user gets 
informed about any new feature added and any updates made in 
the remote branch.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be
easier, and what would be harder?
Without using Git or GitHub, I would collaborate using Dropbox.
It's always easy to upload files to my Dropbox account.
But the changes made in the files cannot be easily tracked using
Dropbox; it is also difficult to know about commit history in Dropbox.
