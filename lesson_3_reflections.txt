When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping 
all your work local?
I would like to use a remote repository when I wish to share my project
files with others in my team. This would enable others to see my code,
and make any required changes in the files, or add any new features 
to the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?
 Manually pulling changes  allows me to remember that certain changes have been made
 in the  file and they are copied to the local repository.
